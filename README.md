Capstone Project - NLP use case 
September 2021 
Rule based coding approaches to analyzing PDFs can provide insights and reports, but are
not scalable. In this project, we have explored some state of the art Natural Language
Processing (NLP) approaches to generalizing the task of extracting key information and
building relationships to develop workflows. The best approach would be the one which
provides accurate results and satisfies key metrics. Through using Pre Trained models and
Fine Tuning, we can achieve results aligned to the use case and domain. Specifically in this
project we applied NLP tasks available in spaCy Natural Language Processing, Rosette
Deep Learning Neural Network, and ELMO. We also explored Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) and the use of available public datasets in the business/legal domain.
This repo contains my code and findings working on spaCy NER and fine tuning the LayoutLM model .
